# Telegram Bot Setup

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the Telegram bot, as well as how to configure webhooks.

## Prerequisites
- A Telegram bot token (create a bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather))

## Setting Up the Environment

2. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:**
   ```env
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<your-telegram-bot-token>
   TELEGRAM_WEBAPP_URL=<your-webapp-url>

   REACT_APP_BOT_ID=<your-telegram-bot-id>
   ```
   Note: You can obtain the bot ID directly from your Telegram bot token in the format `bot_id:secret`.

## Running the Bot

To run the bot, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m web_app.telegram
    ```


## Setting Up Webhooks

To set the webhook for your Telegram bot, follow these steps:

1. Start your FastAPI application (make sure it's accessible from the internet).
2. Call the following endpoint to set the webhook:
   ```http
   GET /api/webhook/telegram
   ```
   This will set the webhook URL to the current request URL.

3. Ensure that your server is publicly accessible so that Telegram can send updates to your webhook.

## Additional Configuration In [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather)

- **Domain:** You need to set a domain for the bot to work properly with the Telegram widget login(frontend).
- **Photo** You need to upload your site's logo, as it will be displayed when users log in through the Telegram login widget![alt text](./assets/image.png)
- **Configure MiniApp URL:** This is optional but recommended for better integration.

## Notes

- Make sure your server is running and accessible to Telegram for the webhook to function correctly.
- You can test the bot by sending the `/start` command after setting up the webhook.
