"""
Tests for the AirDropDBConnector class, covering key database operations for airdrops.

Fixtures:
- db_connector: Provides an AirDropDBConnector instance with test user and airdrop data.

Test Cases:
- test_create_empty_claim_positive: Verifies airdrop creation for an existing user.
- test_create_empty_claim_non_existent_user: Checks error handling for invalid user IDs.
- test_save_claim_data_positive: Ensures claim data updates correctly.
- test_save_claim_data_non_existent_airdrop: Confirms logging for invalid airdrop IDs.
- test_get_all_unclaimed_positive: Retrieves unclaimed airdrops.
- test_get_all_unclaimed_after_claiming: Excludes claimed airdrops from unclaimed results.
